<h2>Top 3 Movies On My List.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Love Actually</h3>

<p>Perfect holiday movie! <br /> I love the fact that there's a difference story for everyone in the movie and not one story is better than another each have their own unique way of making you fall in love with their journeys throughout the movie. <p>Oh and let's not forget it has it's fair share of laughs to LOL.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>

<hr />

<p>I loved the books as a kid so there's no suprise why this is one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time. Just the idea of going to Hogwarts is a fantasy! Unfortunately, not one I'll be able to experience. <br /></p> <p>The way the movies replicate the books is incredible, and the way you feel like you are growing up with Harry makes you feel apart of such a special community. The difference in seriousness from the very fist movie to the last is as an amazing journey that is full of suprises and laughs, but also heartbreak as well. </p> Professor Snape, was not the villian we all thought he was! RIP Dumbledore. </p>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>

<hr />

<p>I mean come on who hasn't at least watched these movies let alone absolutely fall in love with them??!!<p>I've been a fan as long as I can remember, call me a nerd these movies are life changing. I even dressed up as Darth Vader, Anakin and a Storm Trooper for Halloween when I was in Elementary School. Don't lie we all owed at least one thing from Star Wars...</p> A lightsaber for example? We all know those saber fights are SICK!</p>
