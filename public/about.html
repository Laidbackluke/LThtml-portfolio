<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Hawaii in 1996, I have two older brothers and a younger sister. As a child we moved alot to different cities and sometimes different states, which made things very difficult at school. I was bullied in kindergaden and throughout my elementary school life. Growing up with an older brother I did have the luxury of having someone protect me whenever the bullying got too much. I never made my parents aware of me being bullied, I'm not sure why but the only thing I can remeber is being afraid of mentioning anything about it so instead I kept my mouth closed and pushed on.</p>

<p>In my middle school and high school years things were alot easier for me. I had made a good amount of friends and wasn't being bullied anymore, although just like every other kid in school I did have my fair share of occasional fights with other kids. Middle school was a breeze, as a freshman I played for my high school football team and instantly fell in love with the sport and the respect you got from your teachers and other classmates. This definitely helped me become less antisocial which is what I suffered from for as long as I could remember. High school was everything I thought it would be, from playing high school sports, learning things about myself and meeting to people. High school is where I discovered my first love and multiple different relationships throughout my four years. As I look back now I do not regret any decisions I made but I do reminisce and miss the times of not having to worry about growing up and paying bills and having the amount of responsibilites I find myself dealing with now. High school was such a simplier life and I miss it, but just like everything else good things always come to and end you have to move on in life.</p>

<p>Today I am a proud father to my two kids. My daughter Arielle and my son Enzo, both who are the biggest blessings in my life. They have opened my mind in ways I never thought possible, but with every parent I have tons of stress and even more responsibility than before being a father. I live a somewhat comfortable life, there are things I still want to do to better myself and to ensure my kids have a bright future to look forward to. I work as a Construction Project Engineer, and although the pay is great and so is the company I find myself wanting to chase something completely different from what I'm used to and that is becoming a full stack web developer. I love technology and everything associated with creating things from just a thought in my mind. Taking thoughts and creating them into a reality is so intriguing. So I am battling working a full time job, being a full time father, and also taking web development classes, I am fully determined to make this my new reality and I am so stoked to make it happen.</p>
